<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<p>In town I grew up in, there is an ice cream shop called Richardsons Ice Cream and I have worked there part time for four years. I scooped ice cream and I used the register to make financial transactions. During the summer of my freshman and sophomore years of high school I worked at the local summer camp as a counselor. During the summer after graduating high school, I worked at a company that makes cannoli. Most of the time I created commission reports to send to brokers for our bigger customers like Walmart, Target, Hannafords, Cumberland Farms and Market Basket. This past summer I had a paid internship at Charles River Analytics in Cambridge. I assisted the office manager with her daily tasks, for example, stocking the kitchen and supply closets, creating fedex labels and building/moving furniture. I also did basic data entry for the accounting department because they were switching over their accounting software. Everyday I covered the front desk during the receptionist lunch break. I signed off and distributed the mail when it arrived, collected people's license and issued badges so they could enter our office. <p>
