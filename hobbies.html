<h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
<p> I really like the ocean whether its going to the beach with friends or hanging out on the boat with my family. I have a beach house two hours away from my house in Buzzards Bay near the cape in Massachusetts. I also enjoy fine dining and shopping. I like dogs and I have two dogs right now. My dogs are named Henry and Brittney. I really enjoy being in the outdoors and attending sports events.</p>
