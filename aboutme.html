<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samantha Glynn but I prefer that people call me Sammy. My birthday is February 5, 1999, so I am currently nineteen years old. I grew up and lived my whole life in Middleton Massachusetts. Middleton is a small town about thirty minutes north of Boston. The population of Middleton is not big enough to have its own public high school so I attended a regional high school with two of the neighboring towns called Masconomet Regional High School. I graduated in June 2017 and now I attend University of Maine in Orono.<p>
